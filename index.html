        <p>
          My name is Kimani Kelly I'm 23 years old and currently working full time as an Automotive Technician at Lexus of Route 10 in Whippany, NJ. My hobbies consist of skating with my friends around different local skateparks and working on cars. I started working on cars when I was 15 out of curiosity to take things apart and learn how they work and long nights of playing Midnight Club. Eventually, I was able to apprentice at an independent shop in Orange, NJ while attending Union County Vocational Technical School in Scotch Plains, NJ up until senior year of High School. After graduating High School I attended Universal Technical Institute for Automotive Technology for a year and a half. After graduation, I started working for Autoland Toyota in Springfield, NJ for another year and a half and moved on to currently work for Lexus of Route 10.
